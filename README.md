# 👨‍💻 Ricardo Pereira

I am a Computer Systems Engineering student at IPCA with a strong interest in software development, databases and Agile methodologies. I have hands-on experience from three curricular internships, including Erasmus+, where I worked in development, system auditing, prototyping, testing and technical support. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I developed skills in C, C++, C#, Python, SQL, data modelling, .NET and tools such as Git, Azure DevOps, Figma and Visual Studio. I enjoy structured work, learning quickly and adapting to different teams and environments. I aim to continue growing in the IT field, contributing with dedication, responsibility and a strong desire to develop professionally.
